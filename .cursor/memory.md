# PROJECT CONTEXT
- **Goal**: A Node.js web app for uploading and analyzing EEG EDF files locally on the browser using pyodide. 
- **Current State**: 90% of the main features are done, working on implementing some smaller features and a lot on UX, UI design, refactoring the codebase and cleaning the repo.
We are only working on the components under the "Browser Python" tab of the web app. The SSVEP Tool and Experiment can be ignored for now



# FOLLOW BRAND STYLE GUIDELINES
- Use the color scheme and style you will find in `src/app/styles/globals.css` for the new sections you develop and add to the web app
